# My first Python lab in my CIS129 course
#Today I went to my first class of the week but the teacher wasnt there. So one student volunteered to teach the class for the day. He was the smartest student in class so I was pretty sure what he was talking about. When the class end the teacher that was suppose to teach was hiding in the ceiling and it was all planned and he was happy for what happen so he gave us an A in his class.
